# skinPliment
This application allows a user to build a morning and evening routine. The user can enter the name of products to create each routine, with further parameters including product type and description that can be filled in for improved clarification.
## Motivation
From the middle of my teenage years I developed quite severe acne which made me extremely self concious, the fact that I also went to a boarding school meant there wasn't really anywhere to hide as I was in the presence of other students literally all the time. My skin is has significantly improved as a result of a consistent skincare routine I have implemented which I have been using for years now. With this application it will be simple for other users to create, update and keep track of their own skincare routine in their own journey.
